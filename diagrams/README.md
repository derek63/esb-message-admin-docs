The diagrams in this documentation were created with [draw.io](https://draw.io) and there is a Chrome plugin for editing
and saving files locally if you don't want to log into their site with one of the cloud storage services.

Unless you are a masochist, you should use the draw.io tool and not try to hand-edit these XML files.
