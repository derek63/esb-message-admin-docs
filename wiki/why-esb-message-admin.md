# Why ESB Message Admin?

Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) systems don't always come with tools for managing messages    

## I don't use an open source-based ESB, can I use ESB Message Admin
Yes!  ESB Message Admin is designed to work with any ESB system, as interactions with the system are all done via REST
services.  In the future, we plan to add mediators that can read from queues and submit the messages to EMA for you.

## How can ESB Message Admin help me?
It provides out-of-the-box capabilities for storing, viewing, re-submitting, and re-syncing messages.  It also has
capabilities for encrypting sensitive information in messages so they are not stored or viewed in the clear.
