# Why ESB Message Admin?

Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) systems don't always come with tools for managing messages    

## I don't use and open source-based ESB, can I use ESB Message Admin
Yes!  ESB Message is designed to work with any ESB system, as interactions with the system are all done via REST services.  In the future, we plan to add mediators that can read from queues and submit the messages to EMA for you.

## How can ESB Message Admin help me?
It provides out-of-the-box capabilities for storing, viewing, re-submitting, and re-syncing messages.  It also has capabilities for encrypting sensitive information in messages so they are not stored or viewed in the clear.
